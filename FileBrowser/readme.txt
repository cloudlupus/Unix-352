To run the program.
	run the make file
	run ./FileBrowser
	this automatically finds the /home/username directory.

	from here folders are populated when clicked on. So if a folder doesn't appear to have sub folders click on it and there is a high likely hood that the folders will be there.

	The program doesn't display hidden folders.

	WARNING: DO NOT OPEN LARGE FILES WITH THE HEX VIEWER IMPLEMENTATIN OF THE HEX VIEWER IS VERY POORLY DONE AND WILL LOCK UP UNTIL COMPLETELY LOADED. LARGE FILES MAY NOT OPEN IN A TIMELY MANNER.
		TEST CASE WAS A 770MB text file. I LET IT TRY TO OPEN FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES BEFORE I FORCED THE PROGRAM TO CLOSE.

	Note: You must have the courier new font for this to work as the program uses this for displaying the hex editor. This was needed for a reliable monospaced font for formatting purposes.

	Size of files are displayed as raw byte number and not in a human readable format.
